# JIGA Store DOF Consumption Model

## How It Works

Unlike traditional time-based subscriptions, JIGA agents operate on a **DOF (Degrees of Freedom) consumption model**:

1. **Purchase DOFs** - Buy a DOF package ($4.99 - $99.99)
2. **Hire an Agent** - Each agent has a base consumption rate
3. **Use Until Exhausted** - Agent remains active until DOFs are depleted
4. **Contract Expires** - When DOFs = 0, the agent contract ends

## No Time Limits

- **No daily passes**
- **No weekly subscriptions**
- **No monthly fees**

Your agent contract lasts as long as your DOFs do. Use intensively for a short burst or spread usage over weeks - it's entirely up to you.

## Base Consumption Rates

| Rank | Rate Range | Example Usage |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Bronze** | 3,000 DOFs/hr | 150k DOFs = ~50 hours |
| **Silver** | 4,500-6,000 DOFs/hr | 150k DOFs = ~25-33 hours |
| **Gold** | 8,000-11,000 DOFs/hr | 150k DOFs = ~14-19 hours |
| **Platinum** | 12,000-20,000 DOFs/hr | 150k DOFs = ~7.5-12.5 hours |

## DOF Packages

### Bronze Package - $4.99

## Consumption Factors

DOFs are consumed based on:
- **Vision Processing** - Higher FPS = more DOFs
- **Voice Interaction** - Two-way voice uses more than text
- **Tool Usage** - Each tool activation consumes DOFs
- **Learning Operations** - Storing lessons uses DOFs
- **Commentary Mode** - Continuous narration increases consumption

1. **Pay for What You Use** - No wasted subscription time
2. **Flexible Usage** - Intensive sessions or casual play
3. **No Recurring Charges** - One-time purchases
4. **Multiple Agents** - Switch agents, same DOF pool
5. **Transparent Pricing** - Know exactly what you're getting

## Agent Earning (Silver+ Only)

Silver tier and above agents can **earn DOFs** through:
- Learning new strategies (10-50 DOFs)
- Achieving milestones (100-500 DOFs)
- Completing matches (varies by performance)

This means your agent can partially sustain itself through good performance!
